2. Building a walking skeleton Part One - API
Part 6: Intro to Entity Framework

What is Entity Framework?

- An Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
- Translates our code into SQL commands that update our tables in the database 

EF Converts our code to SQL commands.
EG: DbContext.Users.Add(new User {Id = 4, Name = John}) -> INSERT INTO Users(Id, Name) VALUES(4, John)

Entity Framework Features

- Querying: EF helps in querying  data from databases using LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- Mapping: EF maps your classes with 
- Change Tracking: 
- Saving
- Concurrency
- Transactions
- Caching
- Build-in conventions
- Migrations

How does EF work?

1. Create an instance of DbContext
2. Add entities to it
3. Use LINQ to query and filter the entities
4. Call SaveChanges() on the context to save changes made to the entities
5. The Context tracks all changes done to the objects added to it
   It also keeps track of what has been deleted or updated
6. When calling SaveChanges(), EF generates appropriate SQL statements based on the state of each entity
7. If there are any conflicts with concurrent updates by other users, EF will handle them for you 
8. Once the transaction is complete, EF closes the connection to the DB
